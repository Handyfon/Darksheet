Features:

- Expands on the base D&D 5e sheet
- Track food, water, fatigue, temperature, wounds, sanity, and spell burnout with ease
- Easy inventory management with slot-based inventory, Ammodice, and tracking of an item's notches, temper, and fragility
- When an item receives a notch, its damage is automatically reduced, or increased upon repair. The same applies to armor and AC.
- Features numerous automations, such as automatically rolling for burnout after casting a spell, with variants for different rulesets
- Highly customizable, allowing you to use most features independently
